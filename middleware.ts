 * These are ABUSE GUARDS, not the product's free-reading quota.
 *
 * The quota — 7 free readings per person — is per-user and lives in
 * localStorage (see TarotCard). It cannot live here: an IP is not a person.
 * Mobile carriers and offices put hundreds of people behind one address, so an
 * IP limit tight enough to be a quota would lock out real users the moment two
 * of them shared a network. That was the original bug.
 *
 * What an IP limit IS good for is capping the damage when someone scripts the
 * endpoint to run up the Anthropic bill. So these are set far above anything a
 * human would reach, and only exist to bound cost.
