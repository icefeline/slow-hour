/**
 * SPEC §08. The card's notes, and the memory they carry.
 *
 * Every note in the recipe, not a fixed six. The recipes run from five notes to
 * eleven, and the memory paragraphs were written against all of them — printing
 * only the first six would have quietly dropped material the prose is leaning
 * on.
 *
 * The ASCII drawing that bleeds off the top-right in the reference is not here:
 * the `asc-` set covers a handful of notes out of the deck's full palette, so
 * most cards would show a drawing belonging to a note they don't contain. The
 * block clips its own overflow already, so the layer can be dropped back in when
 * the drawings are complete without moving anything else.
