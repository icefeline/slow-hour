 * Terms and privacy, on one page.
 *
 * Headings are machine voice, the prose is not — the reading page established
 * that split, and this is the one place in the app that has to be both a list
 * of what the software does and something a person can actually read.
 *
 * This page does NOT follow the app's lowercase house style, deliberately. The
 * rest of slow garden is lowercase because it is speaking quietly to one
 * person; this page is a legal document that someone may need to skim for a
 * single clause, or read carefully before deciding whether to trust the app
 * with their birth time. Sentence case, real paragraphs and lists are what make
 * that possible. Lowercase here read as style getting in the way of the one
 * page where clarity outranks tone.
 *
 * Everything stated here is checked against the code rather than aspired to. If
 * a data practice changes, this page changes in the same commit: a privacy
 * policy that describes an older version of the app is worse than none, because
 * it is a promise the software is no longer keeping.

            slow garden is a web app that draws you one tarot card a day and writes a short
            reflection to go with it. It runs entirely in your browser. There is no account,
            no login, and no database anywhere with your name in it &mdash; which makes most
            of what follows shorter than you might expect. Jump to{' '}

        <Section id="terms" title="TERMS OF USE">
          <Clause title="Using slow garden means agreeing to this">
            <p>
              If you use slow garden, you&apos;re agreeing to what&apos;s on this page. If
              some part of it doesn&apos;t sit right with you, the honest answer is to stop
              using it &mdash; and nothing of yours is left behind when you do.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="You should be at least 13">
            <p>
              slow garden is not built for children. If you&apos;re under 13, please
              don&apos;t use it. If you&apos;re between 13 and whatever counts as an adult
              where you live, have a parent or guardian read this with you.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="What you can do with it">
            <p className="mb-4">
              Use it for yourself, as much as you like, for free. What we&apos;d ask you not
              to do:
            </p>
            <List>
              <li>Script or scrape it</li>
              <li>Resell it, or republish the readings as your own</li>
              <li>Try to slip past the rate limits</li>
              <li>Use it to build a competing service</li>
            </List>
            <p>The readings are for you.</p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="There is no account, and that cuts both ways">
            <p>
              Everything slow garden knows about you lives in your browser&apos;s local
              storage. That&apos;s good for privacy and unforgiving in every other respect.
              Clear your browser data, use private browsing, or switch to another device,
              and your history is gone. We can&apos;t recover it, because we never had a
              copy. If a year of readings would hurt to lose, keep your own notes elsewhere.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="What you write stays yours">
            <p>
              Your reflections belong to you. We claim no licence over them and no right to
              use them &mdash; which is easy to promise, because they never leave your device
              in the first place.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="What slow garden is not">
            <p className="mb-4">
              This matters more than the rest of this page, so plainly:
            </p>
            <List spaced>
              <li>
                <Term>It is not advice.</Term> Nothing in it is medical, psychological,
                legal, or financial guidance, and it should never be used in place of a
                professional who knows your situation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>It does not predict anything.</Term> The cards are drawn from the date
                and the readings are written by a language model. Both can be wrong, strange,
                or simply unhelpful on a given day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>It is a prompt, not a verdict.</Term> Treat a reading as something to
                think against &mdash; never as a fact about your life, or as a reason to make
                a decision you wouldn&apos;t otherwise make.
              </li>
            </List>
            <p>
              If you&apos;re struggling, please talk to someone real. A friend, a doctor, or
              a crisis line in your country will all serve you better than an app about
              flowers and tarot cards.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="It may change, and it may stop">
            <p>
              slow garden is made by one person and given away. Features can change or
              disappear, the app can be offline, and readings are limited so the costs stay
              survivable. There&apos;s no guarantee it will keep working, and no promise it
              will still be here next year &mdash; though the intention is that it will be.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="If you buy me a coffee">
            <p className="mb-4">
              The support link is a gift rather than a purchase, and it isn&apos;t
              refundable. What it does do is lift the seven-reading limit, for good. That is
              a thank-you, not a transaction: the readings you&apos;ve already had are yours
              either way, and nothing about the app is held back from anyone who
              doesn&apos;t.

            <p className="mb-4">How the unlock works:</p>
            <List spaced>

                <Term>Buy Me a Coffee handles the payment.</Term> We never see your card.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>Your code is worked out from your email address.</Term> It&apos;s a
                signature we can check rather than a record we look up, so unlocking still
                doesn&apos;t create an account. The code can&apos;t be turned back into your
                address, so it gives away nothing about you if you lose or share it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>You paste it in once.</Term> That&apos;s the whole of it &mdash; no
                subscription, nothing to cancel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <Term>Your address and code are kept for 90 days,</Term> so we can send the
                code and resend it if it goes astray. Then they&apos;re deleted.
              </li>
            </List>
            <p>
              That 90-day record is the only thing in slow garden stored on a server rather
              than on your device, and it exists solely to get you the thing you paid for.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Provided as it is">
            <p>
              slow garden is provided as it is, without warranties of any kind, to the
              fullest extent the law allows. To the same extent, we&apos;re not liable for
              any loss arising from using it or from not being able to use it, including
              lost readings or reflections. Some places don&apos;t allow those exclusions; if
              yours is one, they simply don&apos;t apply to you.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Governing law">
            <p>
              These terms are governed by the laws of Singapore, and the courts of Singapore
              have jurisdiction over any dispute. If you&apos;re a consumer somewhere with
              protections that can&apos;t be waived by agreement, you keep those.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Changes to these terms">
            <p>
              If these terms change, the updated version appears here with a new date at the
              top. Continuing to use slow garden after that means the new version applies.

              database with your name in it, because we don&apos;t have a database. We
              don&apos;t sell anything, we don&apos;t advertise to you, and there&apos;s
              nobody here reading your reflections. A few small things do have to leave your
              device for the app to work at all, and the rest of this page is us being
              specific about which ones.

                you&apos;ve written &mdash; those are stripped out before the report leaves
                your device or our server, by a filter that works on the shape of the data
                rather than a list of places to look, so new code is covered the day

              can say no. We round the coordinates to about a kilometre, keep them on your
              device, and send them to our own reading endpoint so it can work out your
              sunrise, sunset, and moon phase. That&apos;s all they&apos;re for. They

          <Clause title="Data leaving Singapore">
            <p>
              The services above operate internationally, so the small amount of data
              described here is processed outside Singapore, including in the United States
              and the European Union. We rely on those providers&apos; own contractual
              safeguards for those transfers, and send them no more than what&apos;s listed
              above.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Your rights">
            <p className="mb-4">
              Under Singapore&apos;s PDPA you can ask for access to, or correction of,
              personal data an organisation holds about you. If you&apos;re in the UK or the
              EU, we&apos;ll honour the equivalent GDPR rights; if you&apos;re in California,
              the CCPA ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In practice all of those requests have the same short answer: we hold nothing
              about you to hand over, correct, or erase. What exists is in your browser,
              where you can read it, change it, or clear it whenever you like, without asking
              anyone. The one exception is a supporter code, which you can ask us to delete
              at any time.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Children">
            <p>
              slow garden isn&apos;t intended for anyone under 13, and we don&apos;t knowingly
              collect anything from them. Since there are no accounts, there&apos;s nothing
              for us to look up or delete, and clearing the browser removes everything the
              app has kept.
            </p>
          </Clause>

          <Clause title="Changes to this policy">
            <p>
              If what the app does with data changes, this page changes with it, in the same
              release. The date at the top tells you when it last did.
