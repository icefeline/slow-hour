// ── 27 Nakshatras ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// In Vedic astrology the janma nakshatra (birth lunar mansion) is the most
// personal marker — more specific than rashi, unique to a ~1 day window.
// Each has a ruling planet (whose dasha themes colour the soul's path) and a
// core quality that shapes how the person experiences and moves through life.
const NAKSHATRAS = [
  { name: 'ashwini',          planet: 'ketu',    quality: 'swift and instinctive — moves before thinking, heals by doing, carries more under the surface than the speed suggests' },
  { name: 'bharani',          planet: 'venus',   quality: 'holds the full weight of experience — transformation through intensity, nothing is picked up or put down lightly' },
  { name: 'krittika',         planet: 'sun',     quality: 'cuts to what is true — high standards, a refiner not a collector, finds it hard to settle for less than the real thing' },
  { name: 'rohini',           planet: 'moon',    quality: 'deep sensory richness — creativity that needs fertile ground, drawn to beauty and rootedness, slow to leave what it loves' },

  { name: 'pushya',           planet: 'saturn',  quality: 'nourishes everything it touches — carries others as a form of meaning, sometimes forgets to carry itself' },
  { name: 'ashlesha',         planet: 'mercury', quality: 'penetrating insight — sees through surfaces, holds on, wisdom earned through pressure rather than ease' },
  { name: 'magha',            planet: 'ketu',    quality: 'ancestral weight and authority — carries the past, leads from lineage, pride as both gift and burden' },

  { name: 'uttara phalguni',  planet: 'sun',     quality: 'service and steadiness — takes on responsibility after the joy, builds things designed to last' },

  { name: 'chitra',           planet: 'mars',    quality: 'brilliance and craft — makes things beautiful and meaningful, becomes restless without something to build or shape' },

  { name: 'vishakha',         planet: 'jupiter', quality: 'driven by purpose — once the goal is set, everything else becomes noise; intensity in pursuit, difficulty letting go mid-path' },
  { name: 'anuradha',         planet: 'saturn',  quality: 'devotion and loyalty — goes all the way in, carries the weight of relationships as a form of meaning, slow to leave' },

  { name: 'mula',             planet: 'ketu',    quality: 'pulled toward roots and dissolution — not satisfied until reaching the origin of things, unafraid of what others avoid' },
  { name: 'purva ashadha',    planet: 'venus',   quality: 'fierce and undefeated — internal strength that does not advertise itself, moves with quiet conviction' },
  { name: 'uttara ashadha',   planet: 'sun',     quality: 'quiet permanence — builds slowly and lasts long, values what endures over what impresses, principled to a fault' },
  { name: 'shravana',         planet: 'moon',    quality: 'listens before it speaks — processes the world by receiving it, hears what others miss, needs to digest before responding' },
  { name: 'dhanishtha',       planet: 'mars',    quality: 'rhythm and abundance — moves between worlds easily, gathers and gives in equal measure, a certain restless vitality' },
  { name: 'shatabhisha',      planet: 'rahu',    quality: 'healing through solitude — needs space to understand things, carries a quiet depth that is not always easy to access' },
  { name: 'purva bhadrapada', planet: 'jupiter', quality: 'fire beneath the surface — intense inner life, transformation through heat, not easily read by the people around them' },
  { name: 'uttara bhadrapada',planet: 'saturn',  quality: 'still depths — slow to act but thorough, carries something ancient, not easily shaken by what rattles everyone else' },
  { name: 'revati',           planet: 'mercury', quality: 'compassionate completion — feels everything, carries others across thresholds, sometimes loses the boundary between self and world' },

This is what they read first — a brief, personal reflection that shows their chart has actually been considered, and opens toward their first card draw.

This app uses Jyotish, not Western astrology. That means:
- The janma nakshatra (birth lunar mansion) is the most personal and distinctive marker — lean into it heavily
- The janma rashi (moon sign in Jyotish) is the primary identity marker — more important than the sun sign
- Do NOT write about sun sign energy as the main thing — the nakshatra and moon rashi say more
- The ruling planet of the nakshatra colours what the soul is being asked to work with

Voice (non-negotiable):
- Entirely lowercase, no em dashes, no exclamation marks
- Perceptive friend who just looked at the chart — warm and specific, not practitioner-speak
- Begin with this greeting (choose the one that best fits the nakshatra energy): ${greetingHint}
- After the greeting: 3 sentences only. Each must open with a different word. No sentence after the greeting may start with "you"
- Use varied openers: "there's", "something in", "a lot of what", "for someone", "in people with", "what shows up", "the pattern", "most of what", "some of", "this kind of"
- Be specific to the actual placements — not generic. The nakshatra quality is the anchor
- Final sentence: 5-8 words, quietly gestures toward the card draw
- No nakshatra name, no rashi name, no planet name — describe the quality, embody the concept
- No: "journey", "navigate", "embrace", "explore", "tap into", "delve", "unpack", "honour", "karma", "dharma", "resonate"
- No questions
