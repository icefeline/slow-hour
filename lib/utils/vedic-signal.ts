/**
 * What is actually live in a chart today, read the Jyotish way.
 *
 * The old answer to this question was a Western transit: an outer planet in
 * aspect to a natal planet. Because Uranus, Neptune and Pluto move a degree or
 * two a year, the same handful of aspects stayed in orb for months and the
 * readings said "saturn" or "neptune" almost every day. Nothing else in the
 * chart could ever get a word in.
 *
 * A Vedic reading is layered instead, and the layers move at different speeds:
 *
 *   dasha      the chapter — years, then months for the antardasha
 *   gochara    where the grahas are sitting relative to the janma rashi — weeks
 *   drishti    what is looking at what right now — days
 *   dignity    how well placed today's actor is — the flavour on top
 *
 * Every layer is computed. The one that leads on a given day is chosen from the
 * live candidates, weighted by strength and by the drawn card's affinity, with
 * the day's seed breaking ties — so an ordinary week moves through the chart
 * rather than circling one planet.
