    number: 0,
    uprightMeaning: 'The Fool stands at the edge of a cliff, one foot lifted, ready to step into open air. There is no map here, no guarantee of safety—only the wild call of possibility. This card asks: where in your life are you being called to begin again, to step toward something that excites and terrifies you in equal measure? What would you do today if you trusted that the ground would rise to meet you? Journal about a time when you took a leap and were caught. What part of you remembers how to trust the fall?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Fool reversed is frozen at the cliff\'s edge, one foot hovering but never landing. Fear has a voice here, and it sounds reasonable. But notice: is this caution protecting you, or is it the voice of old wounds convincing you that you are not ready, not worthy, not enough? What story are you telling yourself about why now is not the time? Write it down. Then ask: what if that story is wrong? What would the next smallest step look like—one so small that fear cannot catch you?',

    reversedKeywords: ['recklessness', 'fearfulness', 'risk-taking', 'inconsideration'],

    suite: 'major',
    number: 1,
    uprightMeaning: 'Before The Magician is a table holding a cup, a blade, a branch, and a stone—water, air, fire, earth. Every tool they need is already present. They do not wish for different circumstances; they work with what is here. This card says: look around you. What resources are already in your hands? What skills have you forgotten you possess? Today, you are not lacking—you are learning to see what has always been yours. Write down three things you already have that could help you move forward. Not things you wish you had. Things that are here, now, waiting to be used.',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Magician reversed has all the tools but has forgotten how to use them, or worse—is using them to manipulate, to perform, to convince others (or yourself) of something that isn\'t true. Where are you pretending to have it together? What are you trying to force into being through sheer will, rather than allowing it to unfold? Journal this: if you stopped performing competence and admitted where you feel lost, what help might arrive? What if not knowing is the first honest step toward真 real magic?',

    number: 2,
    uprightMeaning: 'The High Priestess sits between two pillars, one hand on the seen, one on the unseen. She guards the veil between conscious knowing and intuitive wisdom. This card whispers: there is something you already know but have not yet let yourself acknowledge. What truth have you been avoiding? What does your body know that your mind refuses to admit? Journal this—not what you think, but what you feel. What information is your intuition trying to deliver? Close your eyes and listen. Write down the first thing that comes, before logic can edit it.',
    reversedMeaning: 'The High Priestess reversed has turned away from the veil. Either secrets are being kept—from you or by you—or you have lost connection to your inner knowing. Are you ignoring your gut because it tells you something inconvenient? Are you drowning out intuition with noise, with busyness, with the opinions of others? Journal: what am I afraid to know? What truth am I keeping from myself? If your intuition could speak without fear of judgment, what would it say?',

    uprightMeaning: 'The Empress is a fruit tree heavy with harvest, a bird carefully tending her nest. She is the ultimate nurturer, but she also knows: abundance comes from allowing things to grow at their own pace. Where in your life are you being called to create? What needs tending, watering, patience? This card asks you to honor your body, your creativity, your capacity to bring things into being. Journal: what am I gestating right now? What needs my gentle, consistent attention to flourish?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Empress reversed is the garden gone to weeds, the mother who has forgotten to mother herself. Creative energy is blocked—either smothered by perfectionism or neglected entirely. Where have you abandoned your own care? What creative project have you starved of attention?

This card speaks of healthy boundaries, of systems that serve, of leadership that protects rather than controls. Where in your life do you need to establish order? What boundaries would create safety? Journal: what structure am I being called to build? What foundation needs strengthening? How can I lead myself with both strength and compassion?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Emperor reversed is the tyrant, the dam that blocks the river instead of guiding it. Structure has become rigidity. Control has become domination. Where are you wielding power to protect your own fear? Where has discipline become punishment—of yourself or others? Journal this: where am I being too rigid?

    suite: 'major',
    number: 5,
    uprightMeaning: 'The Hierophant is the tree rings—each circle a year of growth, a record of tradition. He is the elder wolf teaching the young to hunt, the honeycomb\'s sacred geometry passed down through generations. This card speaks of inherited wisdom, of learning from those who came before. What traditions ground you? What teachings do you want to carry forward? But also ask: which traditions serve your growth, and which are just familiar? Journal: what wisdom from my lineage—biological or chosen—do I want to honor? What teacher or teaching is calling me now?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Hierophant reversed is the breaking away, the young animal leaving the pack to find its own path. Tradition has become dogma. Teaching has become control.

    number: 6,
    uprightMeaning: 'The Lovers are two trees growing side by side, roots intertwined but each reaching toward their own light. They are mated swans, lifelong partners who choose each other every migration. This card is about union, yes—but also about choice. Who are you choosing? What relationship—romantic, platonic, creative—is calling you into deeper alignment? But note: true partnership requires you to bring your whole self. Journal: what does healthy partnership look like to me? What am I willing to offer? What do I need in return? Where do my values align with those I love?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Lovers reversed speak of misalignment—either with another or with yourself. Values are clashing. The relationship mirror is showing you something uncomfortable. Or perhaps you have abandoned yourself in service of union, twisted your roots to fit someone else\'s garden. Journal this: where have I compromised my values for connection? What part of myself did I hide to be loved? What choice have I been avoiding? If this relationship ended tomorrow, who would I be?',

    number: 7,
    uprightMeaning: 'The Chariot is the river carving through stone—not through force, but through relentless, focused direction. It is the salmon swimming upstream, every muscle engaged toward one goal. This card says: you have what it takes to move forward, but it requires total commitment. What are you moving toward?

Where do I need to trust my own direction, even when others doubt?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Chariot reversed is the river that has lost its banks, flooding everywhere. Energy is scattered. Will is weak or misdirected into aggression. You are either paralyzed by indecision or charging forward without clear direction. Where are you spinning your wheels? What are you trying to control that cannot be controlled?

    name: 'Strength',
    suite: 'major',

    uprightMeaning: 'Strength is not the bear\'s roar—it is the gentle hand that calms the bear. It is the wildflower pushing through concrete, soft but unstoppable. This card speaks of inner fortitude, of power that does not need to prove itself. The strength here is compassion—toward others, yes, but especially toward your own wild, untamed parts. What within you needs gentling rather than forcing? Journal: where am I being called to be soft and strong at once? What fear or anger needs my compassion instead of my control? How can I be fierce and tender toward myself today?',
    reversedMeaning: 'Strength reversed is the moment you forget your own power. Self-doubt has taken the reins. You are either being too harsh with yourself—inner critic running wild—or you have given up entirely, collapsing under the weight. Where have you abandoned your own knowing? What part of you needs you to remember you are capable? Journal this: what would I do if I believed in myself? When have I been strong before?

    number: 9,
    uprightMeaning: 'The Hermit is the lone wolf on the mountain, the single candle burning in darkness, the winter tree stripped bare to reveal its true structure. This is the card of sacred solitude—not loneliness, but chosen withdrawal to hear your own voice. What wisdom can only be found in silence? What truth can only emerge when you stop asking others what to think? Journal: what do I need to step away from to find clarity? What question can only I answer for myself? If I spent a day in complete solitude, what would I discover?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Hermit reversed is isolation without purpose—loneliness masquerading as solitude, or withdrawal that has become avoidance. You have either cut yourself off from community entirely, or you are so lost in your own head you cannot find your way back. Where has solitude become exile? What are you hiding from?

    uprightMeaning: 'The Wheel of Fortune is the spiral of the nautilus shell, seasons turning, the moon\'s phases. It is the undeniable truth that everything changes. What was up will come down. What was down will rise. This card says: you are in the current now, being moved by forces larger than yourself. Fate is turning. Where in your life is momentum building? What cycle is completing? Journal: what is ending naturally? What is beginning? How can I work with this change rather than resist it? What do I need to release to ride this turn of the wheel?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Wheel reversed is resistance to the inevitable. You are trying to stop the seasons from changing, to hold back the tide. Or perhaps you feel that fate is cruel, that luck is always against you. Where are you clinging to what must end? What pattern keeps repeating because you will not learn its lesson?

    suite: 'major',
    number: 11,
    uprightMeaning: 'Justice is the perfect symmetry of a leaf, the balance of the ecosystem, the truth that every action creates a reaction. This card asks: are you living in alignment with your own values? The scales are not about punishment—they are about truth. What have you sown, and what are you reaping? Where do you need to make amends? Where do you need to hold others accountable? Journal: what truth have I been avoiding? Where am I out of integrity with myself? What consequence am I finally ready to accept? What decision requires my complete honesty?',
    reversedMeaning: 'Justice reversed is imbalance—either you are being unjustly treated, or you are avoiding accountability for your own actions. The scales are tipped. Blame is being misplaced. Where are you playing victim when you hold responsibility? Where are you being scapegoated for something that is not yours to carry? Journal this: where am I lying to myself?

    uprightMeaning: 'The Hanged Man is the bat hanging upside down, the tree whose roots become branches when you shift your gaze. This is the sacred pause, the moment of suspension where action is not possible—so you must surrender. What looks like sacrifice is actually initiation. What you thought was up is down.

If I stopped fighting this situation and simply hung here a while, what might I see differently? What wisdom is only available in stillness?',

    number: 14,
    uprightMeaning: 'Temperance is water finding its level, the tidepool at perfect equilibrium, the alchemical marriage of opposites.

What opposing forces within you need to be harmonized? What requires slow, steady alchemy? Journal: where in my life do I need more balance? What extremes am I swinging between? What would it feel like to rest in the center? What two parts of myself are ready to make peace?',
    reversedMeaning: 'Temperance reversed is excess, imbalance, the pendulum swinging too far in one direction. You are either pushing too hard or not enough. Integration has failed.

This card asks you to look directly at what binds you—addiction, unhealthy attachment, self-sabotage, the stories you tell that keep you small. The chains are loose. You could slip them off. But you stay. Why? What do you get from this bondage? Journal: what pattern keeps me trapped? What am I addicted to—substance, person, belief? What part of my shadow am I refusing to face? What would I have to give up if I broke free?',
    reversedMeaning: 'The Devil reversed is the moment you realize the chains were never locked. You are ready to release what has bound you, or you are finally confronting your shadow.

    uprightMeaning: 'Three people work together on a cathedral, each bringing their unique skill. The Three of Pentacles is collaboration—the magic that happens when people build something together. This isn\'t about doing it all yourself. It\'s about recognizing that your work is better when others contribute their gifts. Where do you need help? What could you create if you asked for support? The Three reminds us that mastery isn\'t solitary. It\'s learned in community, built with others, shared generously.',
    reversedMeaning: 'Reversed, the Three of Pentacles shows disharmony in collaboration or trying to do everything alone. Maybe there\'s conflict in your team, or maybe you\'re refusing help because you think asking makes you weak. The reversal asks: what would it feel like to trust others with your vision? What becomes possible when you stop trying to control every detail?',

The Four of Pentacles is the paradox of safety—you\'ve protected what you have, but at what cost? Are you holding so tight that you can\'t move? Are you so afraid of loss that you\'ve stopped taking risks? Where in your life are you clinging to security at the expense of growth? The Four asks: what would it feel like to loosen your grip just a little?',
    reversedMeaning: 'Reversed, the Four of Pentacles shows either reckless spending or finally letting go of control. Maybe you\'re releasing your grip, learning to trust that you\'ll be okay even without the safety net.

The Five of Pentacles is hardship—financial struggle, isolation, the feeling that you\'re on the outside looking in. But here\'s what this card whispers: the door is unlocked. Help is available. You are not as alone as you feel. What support are you refusing to ask for? What resources are you overlooking because pride or shame keeps you from reaching out?',
