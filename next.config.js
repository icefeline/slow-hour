/*
 * Content Security Policy.
 *
 * Everything the app loads it serves itself: next/font downloads the five
 * faces at build time, the card art and the two videos are in public/, and
 * Sentry is tunnelled through /monitoring on this origin rather than calling
 * ingest.de.sentry.io from the browser. So 'self' covers the lot, and any
 * script pulled from somewhere else is something nobody asked for.
 *
 * Two deliberate weaknesses:
 *
 * 'unsafe-inline' in style-src is not optional here. The card page and the
 * onboarding are built almost entirely from React style props, and every one
 * of those becomes an inline style attribute. Removing it would mean moving
 * hundreds of computed styles into stylesheets.
 *
 * 'unsafe-inline' in script-src is the weaker compromise. Next inlines its
 * hydration bootstrap, and doing without means minting a nonce per request in
 * middleware and threading it through — worth doing, but it is a change to how
 * every page is served and does not belong in the same commit as a header. The
 * policy still blocks the thing that matters most, which is loading script
 * from an origin we do not control. Browsers ignore 'unsafe-inline' when a
 * nonce is present, so that upgrade is additive when it happens.
 *
 * 'unsafe-eval' is dev-only: Turbopack's HMR needs it, production does not.

/*
 * Sentry's ingest host, read off the DSN so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The plan was for `tunnelRoute` to make this unnecessary by routing reports
 * through /monitoring on our own origin. It does not take effect under
 * Turbopack — /monitoring 404s on the deployed site and never appeared in the
 * build's route list — so the browser talks to Sentry directly, and a
 * 'self'-only connect-src silently swallowed every client-side error report.
 * The SDK loaded, the events were captured, and the network call was refused:
 * error tracking that looks installed and reports nothing.
 *
 * Naming the host fixes that. The cost is the one tunnelling was for: an ad
 * blocker that recognises the ingest domain can still drop reports, so
 * client-side error volume reads as a floor rather than a true count.
